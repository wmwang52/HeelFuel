## Background

- I collaborated with my team to design and build an iOS application that enhances nutritional awareness and promotes transparency in on-campus dining options. Our team developed the application from scratch and utilized Firebase database and authentication, along with a custom Restful API that retrieves real-time data from UNC's dining hall and restaurant websites. Through the mobile app, students can easily access information on the food served, track calories and nutrients, and identify allergens. Additionally, the app provides personalized meal recommendations based on individual user data, including dietary preferences and restrictions.

## Description 

- The app consists of several screens, providing users a convenient way to track their daily intake of calories, carbs, fat, and protein. The food sections consumed throughout the day are displayed below, with the number of calories consumed from each meal section easily visible. Users can view the macronutrients of their meal section in detail by selecting these sections. Additionally, users can add food items from the dining hall to consider a food detail page that displays all the ingredients and nutrients. Finally, a water tracker is located at the bottom of the app.

## How to run this

- To run the app, clone the repository and launch it within Xcode on an Apple computer.
